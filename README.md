# CSCEA311project

## How to run

* Make sure you have go installed. 

* Download the tsv file below and place it in the same directory as the main.go file. It only contains the data to run the program. Unfortunately it's to large to be uploaded to github at 118 MB. You may need to use your UA google account if you don't have personal one.

* Build the program by running the command ``go build``

* Run the program by running ``./CSCEA311project``

* This assumes you are on linux, or another unix based system.

* It will output the result of a movie search, and give times for how long each process took.
